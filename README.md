# Jeans Market Research

In this research project, i used multiple linear regression models (MLR) to identify the most significant variables in jeans purchase and to forecast the price that customers would pay for jeans based on the research questions conditions, using sales data from the prior year. All variables had <0.05 significance. Store locations were the most significant factor in jeans purchase, suggesting customers made purchases close to where they lived or worked. Employment status was the least significant factor, suggesting importance of anthropological factors e.g.; ubiquity and affordability across all social strata.

## Introduction

Wearing jeans is ubiquitous globally and across all social strata [3] and demographics. According to Statista [4] the value of the global jeanswear market is forecast to grow from $100 billion in 2018 to $127.63 billion in 2023. The USA is the second largest domestic market after China with 26.37% and 29.71% market share respectively (Appendix1 Figure 1 and Table 1). The statistical proportions that drive purchase decisions vary from utility and security in ubiquity [1], fashion and physical appearance and body cues rooted in social anthropology [5] to affordability [2]. Despite ubiquitous use of jeans, there is a limit to what customers can afford. The jeanswear market is also bends to the whims of fashion. Apparel retailers therefore face a dilemma as to how to adjust their stock to market demand, whilst optimising their supply chains. Retailers therefore need to be able to predict or forecast future customer choices.As an important market in the apparel industry, statisticians study the jeanswear market to gain insight into factors that determine purchase decisions. Giving credence to anthropological arguments, Reike, et.al [6] used MLR to determine that purchase intent was most influenced by body image satisfaction than other factors such as morals and beliefs, dressing for occasions, seasons, and the weather.In this context, the purpose of this paper is to address the following research questions

In this context, the purpose of this paper is to address the following research questions;
       1. Are there differences in jeans purchases due to demographic, sociological or financial factors?
       2. What are the most significant and least significant factors that influence jeans purchase?
